    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul style="border: 2px">
      <li>
        2 lbs boneless and skinless chicken thighs chopped into 2-inch pieces
      </li>
      <li>2.5 Tablespoon curry powder separated</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon all-purpose seasoning</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion chopped</li>
      <li>3 green onions chopped</li>
      <li>½ green pepper chopped</li>
      <li>4 garlic cloves chopped</li>
      <li>1 scotch bonner pepper chopped, seeds removed (optional)</li>
      <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme stems removed</li>
      <li>3 Tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>¼ cup water</li>
      <li>1 large russet potato chopped</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add chicken thighs, all-purpose seasoning, 1 Tbsp of curry powder,
        onion, green onions, green pepper, garlic cloves, scotch bonnet pepper
        (if using), and thyme to a large bowl and combine, making sure all
        chicken pieces are covered with the seasoning. Cover and refrigerate for
        at least 1 hour or up to overnight.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Once the chicken is done marinating, remove onions, peppers, and garlic
        cloves from chicken and set aside.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large heavy bottom pot over medium heat. Add
        remaining curry powder and stir, cooking for about 20-30 seconds. Add
        onions, green pepper, garlic cloves, thyme, and scotch bonnet pepper (if
        using) to pot and stir until onions have softened, about 3-5 minutes. If
        your onions and peppers are looking dry, add about 1 Tbsp of water.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Add chicken and ¼ cup of water to the pot. Cover and reduce heat to
        medium low. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 30-35 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        When there is about 15 minutes remaining, stir in potato and continue to
        cook covered.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Once chicken is cooked and potatoes are softened, remove from heat. Salt
        and pepper to taste.
      </li>
    </ol>
